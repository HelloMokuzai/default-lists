# default-lists
A list of default tokens and FTSO providers for BlazeSwap

## How to get your token listed

If you want a token to be listed, you can open an issue with:

- The token's website
- The token's contract address on the chain you want to be added
- The token smart contract shall be verified on the blockchain explorer
- The smart contract shall not allow the minting of an arbitrary amount of tokens (either the minting rules are coded in the smart contract, or the minting permission has been released)
- Providing a logo (svg or transparent webp/png)
  - The logo's shape is enclosed in a circle 
  - The logo must be 500px * 500px
  - The logo must have 8px padding

We will merge only if all above requirements are approved. 

Providing all the above requirements does not guarantee to be merged.

We will not sponsor in any way any kind of token.
